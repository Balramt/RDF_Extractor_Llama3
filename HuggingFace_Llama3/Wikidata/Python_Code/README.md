# HuggingFace Model and Its Evaluation

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks covering topics related to machine learning model evaluation, Gradio I/O operations, and working with a quantized version of the Llama model to generate Triplets from text file.

## Notebooks
# 1. Gradio I/O Operations
 File: Gradio_IO-Copy1.ipynb

This Python notebook involves I/O operations, where it takes a text file as input and generates triplets as output using the Llama3 quantized mode


# 2. Model Evaluation
 File: Model_Evaluation.ipynb

This notebook covers evaluating machine learning models. It include various metrics and techniques for assessing the performance of trained models.

# 3. Quantized Llama Model
 File: Llama3_Quantized.ipynb

This notebook deals with a quantized version of the Llama3 model. Quantization reduces the computational complexity of large models, making them more efficient without significantly affecting performance. The notebook includes introductory information on handling a quantized model and generating triplets from textual
